**Advanced Analytics**: Add statistical analysis (hypothesis testing, regression), machine learning models (forecasting, anomaly detection), and financial metrics (ROI, NPV, cash flow analysis). *Transforms raw data into actionable insights with predictive capabilities and comprehensive financial modeling.*

**Enhanced Visualizations**: A full library of advanced charts (15+ types including heatmaps, Sankey diagrams, geographic maps), interactive dashboards with real-time updates, and export capabilities (PDF, Excel, PowerPoint). *Enables stakeholders to explore data intuitively and share insights across the organization.*

**Enterprise Features**: Multi-user support, collaboration tools, scheduled reports, audit logging, data quality validation, and horizontally scalable architecture for 1,000+ concurrent users. *Delivers enterprise-grade reliability, security, and collaboration for mission-critical data analysis workflows.*

**AI Upgrades**: Autonomous task planning, multi-agent negotiation, persistent memory across sessions, document understanding (PDFs, spreadsheets), and natural language SQL generation. *Elevates the system from reactive analysis to proactive, intelligent data exploration with human-like reasoning capabilities.*

**Strategy Validation Layer**: Automated quality checks for Business Strategist recommendations including coherence validation, feasibility assessment, data alignment verification, and specificity scoring. *Ensures strategic recommendations are actionable, well-grounded in data analysis, and properly prioritized before presentation to stakeholders.*

**Regional & Granular Analysis**: Context-aware data filtering for region-specific, department-specific, and time-period queries. Automatically extracts and analyzes relevant data subsets (e.g., "Asia Pacific profit margins" filters to Asia Pacific region only). *Enables precise, targeted analysis for specific business units, regions, or time periods instead of generic aggregate metrics.*
